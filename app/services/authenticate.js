/**
 * This is not a valid OAuth2 implementation.
 * For that, we would need to head off to another service to auth and receive an access token and a session cookie
 * Before timing out, the site would need to redirect to the auth service and receive another access token
 * The web should not hold refresh tokens.
 * The method of handling this Silent Auth (https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/silent-authentication) within
 * PWAs is generally with an iframe
 *
 * Note: think this process will take a few more iterations as I figure out how to integrate with Google and an
 * owned centralised service
