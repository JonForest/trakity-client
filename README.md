#TODO
* Canceling a new task should clear values and return it to 'minimal' state
* Deleting a new task should clear values and return it to a 'minimal' state
*. Wire up the Add Task button. That should move focus into the current minimal task and expand
4. Keyboard controls wired up
  - n - focus in the minimal edit
  - s - save an edited task
  - c - cancel an edit
  
x. Consider refactoring out 'minimalEdit'
x. Controls for each task are not keyboard accessible. 

# DONE
* Want to be able to expand/contract the minimal edit task in a way that doesn't just need the tab key during edit (16/06/19)
* Saving a minimal edit task should create a new minimal edit task. (16/06/19)
* Adding a minimal edit task and hitting 'enter' to save, should move the focus into the next minimal edit task (16/06/19)



//    todo: try adding the action back onto the <Icon and see if it now throws?
//    todo: remove the action helper and replace with the on helper
//    todo: look at svg-jar to see if it can replace my icon component
