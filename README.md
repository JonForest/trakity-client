# In progress
Looking at the CalDav implementation.
Have a Client API ID: 736957908143-q5c3ci3gmrr6j47cq0a0us4l4of5m740.apps.googleusercontent.com 
Next step is to wire up the OAuth 2 authentication - https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth
Thinking that I should have a 'connect Google calendar' button on there, rather than do it by default - and store any user settings in local storage for now

#TODO
* Wire up the application to talk to the back end using a known user
 ** For now, remove Mirage
* Add the ability to optionally run with / without mirage
 ** Need to make mirage understand how to deal with the permissions/auth etc
 
** New task to default to the nearest half-hour
  * Think about this - should it only show a date picker when not on the calendar, and then switch to a date time picker when added to the map? Think about using local storage to handle saving midway through an edit so data is not lost if navigated or refreshed
* STOP - at this point, consider wiring up a back-end

* Add in Ember Embroider
* Deleting a new task should clear values and return it to a 'minimal' state
*. Keyboard controls wired up
  - n - focus in the minimal edit
  - s - save an edited task
  - c - cancel an edit
* Changing the date on a task should have it animate to it's new home
* Do we want Tags in this version?  
* Remove `class="list-reset"` from <ul> when tailwind updates 
* Should the app write the tasks to google calendar? (thinking yes, but probably need to default to private (if poss with caldav) and also need to not be double counted/shown  )
* Think about if we want to write items back to the Google Calendar (thinking probably not, but maybe?)
x. Consider refactoring out 'minimalEdit'
x. Controls for each task are not keyboard accessible. 

# DONE
* Want to be able to expand/contract the minimal edit task in a way that doesn't just need the tab key during edit (16/06/19)
* Saving a minimal edit task should create a new minimal edit task. (16/06/19)
* Adding a minimal edit task and hitting 'enter' to save, should move the focus into the next minimal edit task (16/06/19)
* Edit of an existing task should open in full edit mode (23/06/19)
* Canceling a new task should clear values and return it to 'minimal' state (23/06/19)
* Use can select a date when editing a task
* Target date should be limited to today and after
* Editing a task should create a temp version, or changeset, so that updates don't immediately impact (e.g. changing date moves the task to another day before save) (25/06/19)
* Changing date should move the task into another list (25/06/19)
* Import calendar control (https://fullcalendar.io/docs/getting-started)
* Investigate how to add calendar items from the UI
* Move calendar items by dragging
* Change the snap duration for a task to 10 mins
* Investigate how to hook up an external calendar - within Calendar control
* Hook up calendar such that when you change days, it fetches new calendar events from google
* Change the time range of the calendar to be more practical

//    todo: try adding the action back onto the <Icon and see if it now throws?
//    todo: remove the action helper and replace with the on helper
//    todo: look at svg-jar to see if it can replace my icon component
