* Investigate how to add/update items back into remote calendar
* Add in Ember Embroider
* Deleting a new task should clear values and return it to a 'minimal' state
*. Keyboard controls wired up
  - n - focus in the minimal edit
  - s - save an edited task
  - c - cancel an edit
* Changing the date on a task should have it animate to it's new home
* Do we want Tags in this version?  
x. Consider refactoring out 'minimalEdit'
x. Controls for each task are not keyboard accessible. 

# DONE
* Want to be able to expand/contract the minimal edit task in a way that doesn't just need the tab key during edit (16/06/19)
* Saving a minimal edit task should create a new minimal edit task. (16/06/19)
* Adding a minimal edit task and hitting 'enter' to save, should move the focus into the next minimal edit task (16/06/19)
* Edit of an existing task should open in full edit mode (23/06/19)
* Canceling a new task should clear values and return it to 'minimal' state (23/06/19)
* Use can select a date when editing a task
* Target date should be limited to today and after
* Editing a task should create a temp version, or changeset, so that updates don't immediately impact (e.g. changing date moves the task to another day before save) (25/06/19)
* Changing date should move the task into another list (25/06/19)
* Import calendar control (https://fullcalendar.io/docs/getting-started)
* Investigate how to add calendar items from the UI
